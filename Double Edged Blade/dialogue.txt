(Summer term at Laurum Secondary Academy...)
(Life is rather slow around this time, and not much really goes on, to be honest.)
(Sometimes I think I'm just waiting for something to happen.)
Your class' form tutor arrives. You don't pay much mind, but instead wait for your name to be called for attendance.
Good morning everyone! Sorry I'm late- Let's start off with registration, shall we?
Let's see...
“Catherine?” “Here, Miss.”
“Catia?” “Here, Miss.”
“Antoine?” “Here, Miss.”
The sound of names and responses becomes simple background noise to you.
“Elise?”
Here, Miss.
(That's all I have to listen out for.)
And that's everyone!
Now, today, I have some exciting news...
Tomorrow, a new student is joining our class!
(!)
(New student...?)
(But there's only two weeks of school left...?)
Now, we'll all make him feel welcome, alright?
That's all the news I have for today. It's time to pack up and go to lessons, have a great day everyone!
(Since a new student is coming...maybe it would be a good idea to meet him...)
(...before everyone else does...)
You watch as everyone else leaves the room.
Um...Miss?
Hello, Elise! Need to ask something?
Uh...yeah...so there's the new student coming in tomorrow...
And usually a student gets the job of giving them a tour around the school...
So I was wondering...
...could I do the tour?
Of course! And thank you for volunteering.
Thanks, miss!
See you later, Elise.
Ah...well, I just did that.
Why did I do that...
I'm not fit to talk to new people...
What if I mess up?
Well...I could just not worry about it.
That takes less energy to do, anyway.
And so arrives the next day.
(Ms Alsudo hasn't arrived yet...)
(Maybe she'll forget about the tour thing and I'll not make a fool of myself...)
She arrives.
(Oh.)
Everyone, this is the new student I mentioned yesterday!
She turns towards someone unfamiliar.
Would you like to introduce yourself?
Uh…hello, e-everyone,
Um...my name is Raymond, uh…i-it’s nice to meet you all...
And...that’s--that’s all I have to say for now.
Thank you, Raymond. Now, let’s see...
You can go sit next to Elise over there at the back, okay?
(O h .)
Right, now that’s sorted, we can start with the register.
The teacher starts to call the register.
“Catherine?” “Here, Miss.”
“Catia?” “Here, Miss.”
(Alright. New person. Right next to me.)
(Now, I could try to strike up a conversation...)
(...ehhh, but pretending not to notice him is a lot less risky...just don’t look up...)
Hi.
(Ah, great.)
(How are you supposed to do this…? Uh...)
H-hi…
You continue sketching, trying not to look up.
(Oh my goodness, I said that awkwardly...)
“Johanna?” “Here, Miss.”
That’s a nice drawing you’re making.
O-oh...thank you.
It looks like a pair of wings!
Well,uh...y-yes, it is...just some plans for something…
Oh, what are you planning?
(No...if I tell him what it is he’ll probably think it’s weird...)
N-nothing important…(!)
“Johanna?” “Here, Miss.”
“Antoine?” “Here, Miss.”
(Come on, get it together...what happened to 'getting to know someone new'?)
You place your pencil onto the table.
(Alright, let's try it.)
So uh...what did you say your name was?
“Raymond?”
Here, Miss.
Ah, nice to meet you, Raymond. My name is-
“Elise?”
Here, Miss.
A pleasure to meet you too, Elise.
(Hey, that worked!)
...
“Raymond?”
Here, Miss.
“Elise?”
Here, Miss.
Right, now that’s sorted, Maribel, can you take this to the office, please?
A student stands up to take the clipboard to the office. The class resumes its chatter.
Raymond? Elise? Please can you come up here for a bit?
(I guess she didn't forget. Ah...it's okay.)
You and Raymond walk over to the teacher.
Elise, you volunteered yesterday to show the new student around, right?
You can do that now, if you’d like.
Yes, I think we’ll do that now, Miss.
Alright, you two can go around the school, just make sure to be back here before the end of form-time.
Thanks, Miss!
The two of you walk outside of the classroom.
So this is the Courtyard, where we all hang around outside of lesson time.
It’s usually quite easy to get to class from here, so there’s little chance of being late.
Click on a door to go towards it.
This is the art studio, where our art lessons are. I come here quite often, I like drawing.
You’re quite good at it too.
Why, thank you!
Hello, Elise! Showing around a new student, are you?
Indeed I am!
H-hi, nice to meet you!
Lovely to meet you too. We’ll see you both in art class, okay?
Okay, bye!
These are the workshops, where we have our engineering classes, my favourite subject!
Wow, I didn't have this while homeschooling…
Ah, hello, Elise! Nice to see you again. Who’s your new friend?
Hi, Mr Silversaw! This is Raymond, he’s joining our class!
Uh...hello!
Nice to meet you, Raymond. I think we have a workshop class today, I’m looking forward to seeing you both there.
Oh, and Elise, is your plan for your project finished?
Yep! Just adding a couple more notes and it’ll be done.
Excellent!
Well now, I suppose you still have places to see, yes?
Ah, that’s right! I’ll see you later, Sir!
Over there's the library. If you're looking for info on basically anything, it's probably in there.
That'll come in useful, I'm sure.
And that's the Theatre building.
There's some classrooms in there, and the theatre's upstairs...
...except it's closed off for renovations right now, so I don't think we can go in there.
Ah, that's too bad.
Speaking of which...should we head back to form now?
...Yes, probably should.
Ah, you’re back! How was it?
It was pretty good,
Lovely! I hope you’ll enjoy your time here. Also, thank you, Elise, for volunteering, you've done a good job.
(I did a good job!)
Thank you, Miss.
Ms Alsudo turns to the rest of the class.
Alright everyone, it’s time to pack up and go to your first lessons, have a great day everyone, and I’ll see you in PM registration!
You and Raymond collect your bags and head off to your first lesson. Your class timetables are nearly identical.
The rest of the day continues pretty normally, as you would expect.
Lunchtime rolls around, and you suddenly remember something you had to attend to.
So you hastily pack your things and run to the workshop.
Good afternoon, Elise! You look a little worn out, did you run all the way here?
Hah...hello, Sir...yeah, I did...
Just...trying to maximise the time I have to work on this project!
Hahah, smart idea! But don't tire yourself, okay?
Okay...!
Good, good!
So, did you finish your sketch?
Yep! I've brought it with me.
You reach into your bag for your sketch.
Looking past all of your books, that one piece of paper is not in sight.
Uh...
Worry not, take your time.
It is…right here…
You cannot find what you are looking for.
Well…that’s strange.
Misplaced it?
I’m sure I put it in here…
Oh, look, Elise, some friends have come to pay a visit!
You look up. Raymond is there with one of your other classmates, Johanna, who is holding a familiar piece of paper.
Oh- hi!
Hey, Elise! Raymond and I just came to give you this- you left it behind in form time.
Johanna hands you your sketch.
I thought I had left it somewhere...thanks!
Of course! Hey, y’know, this thing you’re working on, looks really cool too.
You glance back at the various broken parts of what were meant to be a pair of mechanical wings.
Heh, thanks...well, if I could get it to work…
Ah, this is what you were sketching in class.
I’d tried to test this out the other day...all fell apart.
But you went back to your design, made a few amendments…
Yep. I think I worked out the problem with this...I hope.
How long have you been trying to make it for?
I started this a couple months ago, I think.
Your improved design looks a lot better, we’ll start on it on Thursday. Lunchtime is almost over, so you should get back to class now.
Ah, it’s that time already, see you later, Sir!
See you!
Bye!
Good day, all of you!
You, Raymond and Johanna leave the workshop.
It’s now time to go home.
You're packing your things, when you realise something is not where it should be.
Ah, great, I left my folder in the workshop…
We can quickly go and get it…
Outside the window, the rain is now quite heavy.
...it won’t take long.
The two of you run through the rain into the workshop classroom.
Looks like Mr Silversaw has already left for the day. You see a folder on one of the workbenches.
There it is!
You pick up your folder, at which point a strong breeze blows some loose papers out from it and scatters them on the floor, some sliding underneath the tool cupboard door.
You both pick up the pages scattered around, but when you get the one in the cupboard…
The strong wind blows again, and slams the cupboard door shut, with both of you inside.
What was that-what was that?!
Attempts to open the door prove futile.
Is anyone out there?! We’re trapped!
Oh, Raymond, what do we do?
The lights have been broken for a while...and it's dark...
Well, in that case, I have just the thing for this situation…
He pulls out a box of matches.
Why...why do you have those??
You never know when you’ll need them.
You’re not going to start a fire, are you?
He lights the match.
Only a tiny one.
The two of you sit down, watching the flickering flame of the match.
Well, now...worst case scenario, perhaps Mr Silversaw will find us in the morning?
He teaches part-time, so he won’t be in tomorrow.
Ah. There goes that idea.
Hmm, oh, well....
You sit together in silence.
…
(Did this have to happen?)
(At this time?)
(In a storm, too...it's dark...and nobody's around to get us out...)
The match goes out.
You’re in darkness for a few moments.
AHH-! What was- what was-?!
It’s just the storm outside. It’s alright, don’t worry-
I’m scared, Raymond! What if something happens to us in here?! What if nobody finds us? What if we don’t get out?
I...I don't...
(I can't...)
(...think...my head hurts, and everything feels like ringing...it feels loud...)
Elise, please, calm down!
What is happening here?!
You look up.
What’s that?! What’s happening?!
Are you doing this?
I don’t know!
Can we put them down?
As soon as he says that, a red glow appears to counter the blue, dropping all of the tools onto the floor.
I mean, that works?
Was that me?
We can try that again…
(Unwise.)
He gestures his hand upwards. A small blade appears in front of him, and flies forward into the wall.
Wow…
You try the same, but your blade flies backwards, almost hitting you.
We’d better be careful.
What do we do with this knowledge?
Perhaps...we can find a way out.
Try clicking some of the tools, to find a way out.
You try to pick the lock open.
It doesn't work.
The door is quite stuck in its place.
You notice the knife lodged into the wall, and an idea pops into your head.
We can destroy the lock.
With what we just tried with all those blades...
Though, I doubt how safe this is...
It’s about as safe as freezing to death in a cupboard during a storm.
Huh, that worked! That actually worked!
No more freezing to death in a cupboard during a storm!
You look down at the pile of broken wood, which was once the door.
Except...what do we do with that?
We can explain that later. Let’s get out of here.
You both run through the rain, to the school gate. It’s now dark outside.
Well...that was interesting.
Hahaha! Well, not to worry, this won’t be a regular occurrence, I’m sure.
Yes, definitely.
Well, we’d better get going, before our parents worry too much.
See you tomorrow!
See you tomorrow, Elise.
You arrive home. Your mother has been waiting for you.
My, you’ve come home late, Elise.
I was just working on my project in the workshop.
This late?
...yes.
Your mother gives you a puzzled look.
Are you alright, Elise?
Yes, I’m fine.
Just a little tired. I think I’ll go to bed early tonight.
(I feel unusually tired...this doesn't happen...)
(I don't even have the energy to think anymore...)
By now you've probably noticed the number in the corner of your screen, labelled 'Control'.
The higher it is, the more control you have over your powers, and vice-versa.
It increases when you feel calmer, and decreases when you aren't.
If it hits zero, you’ve completely lost control for good, and the game is over.
Keep it up and you’ll survive. Good luck.
It's the last week of school and today, there’s a school trip to the History Museum in the city.
Okay, everyone, here we are, Scholite University History Museum!
In here you’ll find a lot to learn about the Regions on this island, and about the city, too.
Now, we’ll split into two groups and you can explore around a bit.
Let’s see…
Raymond...
Catherine...
Maribel...
and Fritz...
That's one group, and...
Elise...
Catia...
Antoine...
and Johanna...
In the other group.
Alright, everyone, you’re free to look around, and we’ll meet back here at two o’clock.
Enjoy!
Try clicking on the displays.
Hey...that's my mother!
I almost thought that was you for a minute...
I thought you looked similar!
And that must be the Pseudeland Region's family on the left.
I wonder why the Etceter Region doesn't have a portrait? They're a part of this Isle too...
Oooh, I can see where my home is on here! Realis!
And there’s our school, up in north Scholite City.
The Isle of Scholite seems so much bigger when you look at it as a whole...
They’re pretty well-polished, for having been here so long.
Shiny. And sharp.
(Sharp…very sharp.)
Pay no attention to the sinking feeling inside of you.
Looks like it’s time to head back.
The clock has turned to 2 o’clock.
Alright, everyone, looks like you all found that interesting!
However, we’ll have to get going quickly, before we miss the train home.
You try to stay with the group and not get left behind.
…
You somehow ended up a bit behind.
Looking behind you, there appears to be a sword from that display, now on the ground at the museum entrance.
(How did that…why…??)
As the thought crosses your mind, a blue glow appears around the sword.
It flies right at you.
You start running at full speed to the train station.
The class is already there, and the train has already arrived.
Looking behind you, the sword has now cloned itself into three.
You see Raymond standing at quite a distance from the group.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
What happened??
I don’t know, I looked behind me after you went ahead with the group, and there were three swords rushing at me with full speed!
Oh, goodness…
We should put these back where they belong.
There, that should do it.
Uh....where did everyone else go?
You notice that the train has left without you.
We lost the group?! We lost the group!
Well, darn. How do we get back?
Use the train??
Yes, but...
...which side of the platform did they get on?
Uhh....there's a map? Do you know how to read train maps?
Nope.
I...suppose we’ll have to guess.
Eastbound or westbound train?
Try the eastbound train?
You both board the train.
Now we wait.
The next station comes, and you get off the train.
There they are!
They’re near the platform.
One, two, three, four, five, six…
Ms Alsudo looks your way.
...seven, eight. Alright, that’s everyone.
(That was almost a disaster...)
Try the westbound train?
You both board the train.
Now we wait.
The next station comes, and you get off the train.
Uh….where are we?
No sign of anyone here at all.
Try the other way?
You board the other train.
The train is taking a long time.
You look outside. The city is unfamiliar.
 Have you ever been here before?
Nope.
In an unfamiliar place like this, you start to feel a little uneasy.
The view outside now looks different.
It'll be late soon.
Wait, I usually pass by this station when coming back from school!
!!
You know the way from here?
It's this station.
You leave the train and go upstairs to the station.
The class is there.
You’re here! Where did you both disappear to??
Uh...we kinda missed the train and had to catch up…
Well, as long as you’re here now, it’s alright.
The group returns to the school.
So...last day of school in a couple more days.
Will you be in for that?
Probably not...my parents are going out of the Isle for a week, and they don’t want me going out while they’re not home.
Ah...oh, well.
I suppose I’ll see you in September?
Indeed.
And, if you’re travelling near the Pseudeland region, maybe you’ll find me, hahah!
Ahah, maybe I will!
Well, anyway...bye for now.
And...stay safe.
You too, Elise.
(Stay safe?)
(Easier said than done.)
Pay it no mind.
(But some things are much more difficult to ignore.)
(If I don't think about it, it'll go away, won't it?)
(Won't it?)
End: First Year.

Stay quiet

Double-Edged Blade: All Under Control
*ring ring ring*
The telephone rings from another hallway.
You stare outside of your bedroom window for a while.
(from hallway) Hello, this is the Pseudeland Manor.
Oh, yes, I’ll let them know right away.
Your Majesty, the school just called.
A bird flies past.
(The school…?)
Hello?
Your mother picks up the call.
Yes.
Ah, perfect!
Tuesday? Yes, I’ll inform him immediately.
Yes, thank you. Good evening.
She hangs up the call.
The bird flies back in the other direction.
Raymond? Can you come here for a minute?
You have been summoned.
You walk out of the room and down the hallway, to where the phone is.
Yes, Mother?
Laurum Secondary Academy just called. The arrangements are all finalised, and your first day is on Tuesday.
Tuesday?
Yes. We have everything ready, and we’ll show you how to get there on the day. It’s only a quick train ride.
Where was it, again?
It’s in Scholite City.
But that’s outside of the region...how will I know how to navigate it? I’ve never been outside of the Pseudeland Region…
I’m sure you’ll find your way quickly.
I hope so.
(Well, this is the place.)
(Laurum Secondary Academy.)
(The most expensive private school in Scholite City.)
(My parents say it’s also one of the best…)
(...not that I’ve ever been to any others to compare it with.)
(Apparently, someone was supposed to meet me here.)
(I am in the right place...right?)
(I wonder when-)
Ah, you must be Raymond, our new student!
You flinch a little.
You turn around to see a lady standing behind you.
Y-yes, yes, that’s me!
I must have startled you, sorry about that.
I’m Ms Alsudo, and I’ll be your form tutor here.
Nice to meet you, Raymond!
It’s nice to meet you, too.
Welcome to Laurum Secondary Academy! Now, I arrived a little late, so how about we head over to your form room, and we can get you settled in?
You nod silently, and follow Ms Alsudo out of the school office.
The courtyard is a lot bigger than what you could see from the gates.
So our classroom is just over in the Theatre building...
(This place is so spacious...)
(So this is what a proper school is like.)
(Well, it’s very much different from the study we have at home.)
And this is where you and the rest of your class come to be registered, every morning and afternoon.
How about we go and meet your new classmates?
(Ah, that’s the thing about proper schools. There are other kids here too.)
Everyone, this is the new student I mentioned yesterday!
Ms Alsudo looks your way.
Would you like to introduce yourself?
Uh…hello, e-everyone,
Um...my name is Raymond, uh…i-it’s nice to meet you all...
And...that’s--that’s all I have to say for now.
(Oh yes, very smooth indeed, you fool.)
(That’s one way to make a first impression. Wait until they find out your full title.)
Thank you, Raymond. Now, let’s see...
You can go sit next to Elise over there at the back, okay?
You look over to see a girl sitting alone in the back row. She looks up at the mention of her name.
You go to sit next to her. You notice she’s sketching something on a piece of paper.
Right, now that’s sorted, we can start with the register.
The teacher starts to call the register.
“Catherine?” “Here, Miss.”
“Catia?” “Here, Miss.”
(A class...with other kids...with whom I should interact at some point, right?)
(Well, there’s someone right here.)
(What am I supposed to do? Say something?)
(Maybe I should just...)
Hi.
The girl looks up, seemingly a little startled.
H-hi…
She continues sketching while glancing at you occasionally.
“Johanna?” “Here, Miss.”
(Hmm..should I say something else or stay quiet?)
(What can I say to start a conversation…?)
That’s a nice drawing you’re making.
O-oh...thank you.
It looks like a pair of wings!
Well,uh...y-yes, it is...just some plans for something…
Oh, what are you planning?
N-nothing important…(!)
(I think I might have made her nervous...darn.)
“Antoine?” “Here, Miss.”
The two of you are silent for a while, listening to all the names of other classmates, waiting for your own.
The girl places her pencil onto the table.
So uh...what did you say your name was?
“Raymond?”
Here, Miss.
Ah, nice to meet you, Raymond. My name is-
“Elise?”
Here, Miss.
A pleasure to meet you too, Elise.
(I can see she's trying her best.)
...
“Johanna?” “Here, Miss.”
“Antoine?” “Here, Miss.”
(Alright then, Ray. Stay in this awkward silence you’ve brought upon yourself.)
The two of you are silent for a while, listening to all the names of other classmates, waiting for your own.
“Raymond?”
Here, Miss.
(Darn. I can feel the whole class looking at me.)
“Elise?”
Here, Miss.
(I think that’s everyone.)
Right, now that’s sorted, Maribel, can you take this to the office, please?
A student stands up to take the clipboard to the office. The class resumes its chatter.
Raymond? Elise? Please can you come up here for a bit?
You and Elise walk over to the teacher.
Elise, you volunteered yesterday to show the new student around, right?
You can do that now, if you’d like.
Yes, I think we’ll do that now, Miss.
Alright, you two can go around the school, just make sure to be back here before the end of form-time.
Thanks, Miss!
The two of you walk outside of the classroom.
So this is the Courtyard, where we all hang around outside of lesson time.
It’s usually quite easy to get to class from here, so there’s little chance of being late.

Hi, Mr Silversaw! This is Raymond, he’s joining our class!
Uh...hello!
Nice to meet you, Raymond. I think we have a workshop class today, I’m looking forward to seeing you both there.
Oh, and Elise, is your plan for your project finished?
Yep! Just adding a couple more notes and it’ll be done.

Elise smiles shyly.
Thank you, Miss.
Ms Alsudo turns to the rest of the class.
Alright everyone, it’s time to pack up and go to your first lessons, have a great day everyone, and I’ll see you in PM registration!
You and Elise collect your bags and head off to your first lesson. Your class timetables are nearly identical.
The rest of the day continues pretty normally, as you would expect.
Now it's lunchtime, and you're in the Courtyard.
Everyone’s outside at this time.
You sit alone at a table. Everyone else seems to have friends they’re talking to, except you.
You probably would have stuck with Elise, but she ran off somewhere.
As that thought crosses your mind, you see someone walking towards you.
You’ve seen this girl before, she’s in your registration group.
Hey, Raymond!
H-hi...Johanna, was it?
Yep, that’s me! Can I ask you something real quick?
Um...okay…
D'you know where Elise is? She left this behind in registration.
Johanna holds up the diagram of the mechanical wings Elise had been sketching.
Oh, um...I don’t know, but she said she’s usually in the art studio, or in the workshops?
Ah, okay, let’s go check there, then.
The two of you go to the workshop classroom.
The door is already open, and you see Elise and Mr Silversaw, the engineering teacher. Elise appears to be looking for something in her bag.
I’m sure I put it in here…
Oh, look, Elise, some friends have come to pay a visit!
Elise looks up and sees you and Johanna.
Oh- hi!
Hey, Elise! Raymond and I just came to give you this- you left it behind in form time.
Johanna hands Elise her sketch.
I thought I had left it somewhere...thanks!
Of course! Hey, y’know, this thing you’re working on, looks really cool too.

Ah, it’s that time already, see you later, Sir!
See you!
Bye!
Good day, all of you!
You, Elise and Johanna leave the workshop.
It’s now time to go home.
You pack up your stuff and are ready to go. Elise is looking through her bag, muttering to herself.
Ah, great, I left my folder in the workshop…
We can quickly go and get it…
You look out of the window. The rain seems to have become quite heavy.
...it won’t take long.
The two of you run through the rain into the workshop classroom.
Looks like Mr Silversaw has already left for the day. You see a folder on one of the workbenches.

The strong wind blows again, and slams the cupboard door shut, with both of you inside.
What was that-what was that?!
You try to open the door. It’s locked, and doesn’t open from inside.
Is anyone out there?! We’re trapped!
Oh, Raymond, what do we do?
The lights have been broken for a while...and it's dark...
Well, in that case, I have just the thing for this situation…
You pull out a box of matches from your pocket.

Ah. There goes that idea.
Hmm, oh, well....
You sit together in silence.
…
There are...a lot of tools in here. And they all look...sharp. 
They are.
Have you used any of these before?
A few times, for a few projects.
Like your wings?
Yep.
...
You continue to sit in silence, watching the match.
Elise looks a bit uneasy.
The match goes out.
You’re in darkness for a few moments.
AHH-! What was- what was-?!
It’s just the storm outside. It’s alright, don’t worry-
I’m scared, Raymond! What if something happens to us in here?! What if nobody finds us? What if we don’t get out?
I...I don't...
Amongst Elise’s panicked shouting, you notice a blue glow filling the room.
The tools shake around before flying off of their hooks.
Elise, please, calm down!
What is happening here?!
She looks up to see numerous sharp objects circled around her.
What’s that?! What’s happening?!
Are you doing this?
I don’t know!
Can we put them down?
As soon as you say that, a red glow appears to counter the blue, dropping all of the tools onto the floor.
I mean, that works?
Was that me?
We can try that again…
You gesture your hand upwards. A small blade appears in front of you, and flies forward into the wall.
Wow…
Elise does the same, but her blade flies backwards, almost hitting her.
We’d better be careful.
What do we do with this knowledge?
Perhaps...we can find a way out.
Try clicking some of the tools, to find a way out.
You try to pick the lock open.
It doesn't work.
The door is quite stuck in its place.
You notice the knife lodged into the wall, and an idea pops into your head.
What we tried, just now, with the knives…
What if we tried that again?
Is this safe?
It’s about as safe as freezing to death in a cupboard during a storm.
Huh, that worked! That actually worked!
No more freezing to death in a cupboard during a storm!
You look down at the pile of broken wood, which was once the door.
Except...what do we do with that?
We can explain that later. Let’s get out of here.
You both run through the rain, to the school gate. It’s now dark outside.
Well...that was interesting.
Hahaha! Well, not to worry, this won’t be a regular occurrence, I’m sure.
Yes, definitely.
Well, we’d better get going, before our parents worry too much.
See you tomorrow!
See you tomorrow, Elise.
You arrive home.
Raymond! Where have you been?! I was so worried about you! Are you alright??
I’m okay, Mother, it’s just that…
(Ah, darn. I can’t tell her about what happened. She’ll worry.)
...that I got a little lost on the train coming home. Yes.
But I know the way, now. It won’t happen again.
Later that night...
(Huh...)
(What if I try this...again...)
Don't.
Something about it can't be right.
It's dangerous.
By now you've probably noticed the number in the corner of your screen, labelled 'Control'.
The higher it is, the more control you have over your powers, and vice-versa.
It increases when you feel calmer, and decreases when you aren't.
If it hits zero, you’ve completely lost control for good, and the game is over.
Keep it up and you’ll survive. Good luck.
It's the last week of school and today, there’s a school trip to the History Museum in the city.
Okay, everyone, here we are, Scholite University History Museum!
In here you’ll find a lot to learn about the Regions on this island, and about the city, too.
Now, we’ll split into two groups and you can explore around a bit.
Let’s see…
Raymond...
Catherine...
Maribel...
and Fritz...
That's one group, and...
Elise...
Catia...
Antoine...
and Johanna...
In the other group.
Alright, everyone, you’re free to look around, and we’ll meet back here at two o’clock.
Enjoy!
Try clicking on the displays.
Ooh, look, portrait gallery!
I feel like I’ve seen some of these people before…
You observe some of the pictures on the wall.
Is that…?
Pseudeland’s family.
My parents...?
I thought they kind of looked ike you.
Over here, there's another one.
You look over to see a portrait of the Queen of Realis.
I hear their queen’s a bit of a scary ruler…
I don’t see any paintings from the Etceter region anywhere…
Apparently they're just super secretive?
Hmm…
The entire Isle of Scholite…
Strange, I had never been out of the Pseudeland region before moving to the school.
I can see Laurum Secondary on the map.
I wonder if I can find my home on here…
Scholite City is a lot bigger than I thought.
Maybe one day I’ll explore around some more.
So fancy...and shiny!
…
Uh…
A problem?
No, no, not at all…
(Darn. If something happens here...)
(Turn away now, turn away now...)
Uh...Oh, look at the time!
The clock has turned to two o’clock.
We should be going back now.
You can’t help but notice a faint red glow inside of the display.
Alright, everyone, looks like you all found that interesting!
However, we’ll have to get going quickly, before we miss the train home.
You all walk out of the building and along the road to the train station.
You walk a little bit behind the group.
…
Was that glass breaking?
Hm? What is…
Oh, goodness- Uh…
You’re not supposed to be out of your case! Ah...uh…
Go back- get back to the museum, now.
You gesture upwards, attempting to send it back to its proper place.
The sword moves, seemingly reluctantly, towards the museum entrance, before dropping onto the ground again.
Eh...close enough.
The group has gone ahead, and you run to catch up.
The class arrives at the train station. The train has already arrived.
You’re about to board the train when a blue glint catches the corner of your eye.
You instantly know who it is. And she’s running right towards you. From what, you don’t know.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
She runs past you, and ducks down to let three copies of that same sword zoom past her head.
She reaches her hand out, stopping the blades in an instant.
What happened??
I don’t know, I looked behind me after you went ahead with the group, and there were three swords rushing at me with full speed!
Oh, goodness…
We should put these back where they belong.
There, that should do it.
Uh....where did everyone else go?
You notice that the train has left without you.
We lost the group?! We lost the group!
Well, darn. How do we get back?
Use the train??
Yes, but...
...which side of the platform did they get on?
Uhh....there's a map? Do you know how to read train maps?
Nope.
I...suppose we’ll have to guess.
Eastbound or westbound train?
Try the eastbound train?
You both board the train.
Now we wait.
The next station comes, and you get off the train.
There they are!
They’re near the platform.
One, two, three, four, five, six…
Ms Alsudo looks your way.
...seven, eight. Alright, that’s everyone.
(That was almost a disaster...)
Try the westbound train?
You both board the train.
Now we wait.
The next station comes, and you get off the train.
Uh….where are we?
No sign of anyone here at all.
Try the other way?
You board the other train.
The train is taking a long time.
You look outside. The city is unfamiliar.
 Have you ever been here before?
Nope.
In an unfamiliar place like this, you start to feel a little uneasy.
The view outside now looks different.
The train is taking a familiar amount of time.
You look outside.
Wait, I usually pass by this station when coming back from school!
You know the way from here?
It's this station.
You leave the train and go upstairs to the station.
The class is there.
You’re here! Where did you both disappear to??
Uh...we kinda missed the train and had to catch up…
Well, as long as you’re here now, it’s alright.
The group returns to the school.
So...last day of school in a couple more days.
Will you be in for that?
Probably not...my parents are going out of the Isle for a week, and they don’t want me going out while they’re not home.
Ah...oh, well.
I suppose I’ll see you in September?
Indeed.
And, if you’re travelling near the Pseudeland region, maybe you’ll find me, hahah!
Ahah, maybe I will!
Well, anyway...bye for now.
And...stay safe.
You too, Elise.
(Stay safe?)
(I’ll try to…)
(If I can.)
...
Agh...my head...
it hurts...
...so much...
Increase the input level. No result has shown yet.
Please...don't...
It's for the good of our Region.
The other Regions are right about us...
iT HURTS-!
STOP! THEIR THEORY WAS INCORRECT! THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS DON'T EXIST!
What?
Why...would you believe...the Scholite researchers...?
The King's agents have found the facility.
Stop the research. Leave.
(The hell was that??)
(What kind of dream was that??)
(Just a dream, eh...?)
(Right. Just a dream.)
(Go back to sleep.)

Hello! I'm Eleeza, the creator of this game.
Thank you very much for playing First Year!
You can think of this Year as a sort of taster for the rest of the game - a demo, an introduction to the world.
First 'Year' is actually a misnomer...it should really be 'First...like two weeks I guess.' Ray just joined the school really late in the year.
Well, I hope you enjoyed this first part of the story, because there's much, much more to come!
In the next few Years, Ray and Elise's stories are going to diverge a bit, and things are going to get pretty interesting...
There's still six Years of this game left for me to release, and even more of the story beyond what All Under Control can tell...even beyond Raymond and Elise's stories.
So stay tuned for updates! I'll be updating and polishing this game often, and I'm open to suggestions for improvements.
Anyways, that's all from me for now- see you around!
