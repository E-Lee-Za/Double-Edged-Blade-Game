# Double-Edged Blade - All Under Control

I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna make my first game.

This here repository is for me to make myself actually get serious about making the thing.

---An RPG/Story game---
A story of two young students bound by powers beyond their control.
With two playable characters featuring different scenarios, try to survive six years at a school for the children of nobility...with the powers within you taking over, how long will you keep control?
