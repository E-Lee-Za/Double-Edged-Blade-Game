# Double-Edged Blade - All Under Control

I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna make my first _real_ game.

This here repository is for me to make myself actually get serious about making the thing.
I'm probably gonna just use it to store random stuff related to the thing.

---A visual novel game, made in Ren'Py---
A story of two young students bound by powers beyond their control.
_"I told you two you were next. I promise I won't let you down."_
